# Mobula UI

Management console for [Mobula](../mobula), the Rust control plane for Ray
clusters — a self-hosted, FOSS replacement for the Anyscale console.

The authoritative product/UX spec is [`docs/ui-ux-spec.md`](docs/ui-ux-spec.md).

**Status: Milestone A (Foundation)** — app shell, design system, dev-mode auth,
health indicator, and read-only screens against the Phase-2 backend. Cluster
list and Registry render the typed table UI now and gracefully show
"not implemented yet" empty states until the Phase 3 management API
(spec §8) exists.

## API types are the source of truth

This app does **not** hand-write API shapes or point a codegen tool at a
running server. It depends on
`@brandonrc/mobula-client` — a TypeScript client generated and published by
the [mobula-api](https://github.com/brandonrc/mobula-api) pipeline from
mobula's OpenAPI spec (the Rust code is the source of truth). It republishes
to the GitHub Packages npm registry whenever the API changes. `src/lib/api.ts` re-exports those types.

GitHub Packages npm requires a token even for public packages, so `.npmrc`
reads `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`:

```sh
export NODE_AUTH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token)   # or a classic PAT w/ read:packages
npm install
```

CI supplies `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`. Types annotated "UI-ahead" in
`src/lib/api.ts` (identity, registry, the cluster list view model) are
screens built before the matching endpoint/shape exists in the backend;
each carries a migration note for when it lands.

## Stack

React 19 + TypeScript + Vite · TanStack Query (polling) · TanStack Table ·
react-router v7 · Tailwind CSS v4 + Radix primitives (hand-rolled shadcn-style
components in `src/components/ui`) · class-based dark mode.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- The backend running locally: `mobula serve --dev-allow-unauthenticated`
  (serves `http://127.0.0.1:8484`; the Vite dev server proxies `/api`,
  `/healthz`, and `/docs` to it)

## Getting started

```sh
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
```

## Scripts

| Command           | What it does                                                          |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`     | Vite dev server with proxy to the control plane                        |
| `npm run build`   | Type-check (`tsc -b`) + production build to `dist/`                    |
| `npm test`        | Vitest unit tests                                                      |
| `npm run lint`    | ESLint (flat config)                                                   |

API types are not generated here — they come from the published
`@brandonrc/mobula-client` package (see above).

## Auth (provider-driven: SSO redirect or local login)

`/login` discovers its sign-in methods from `GET /api/v1/auth/providers`
(api-v1.md §5.15, ADR-0011): a **local username/password form** when the
backend runs `--local-auth` (opaque tokens — Mobula stores credentials,
never signs them), **"Sign in with SSO"** when OIDC is configured, or both.
The SSO path is Authorization Code + PKCE (S256) directly against the
issuer — the standard SPA pattern, no client secret and no backend session
endpoints (api-v1.md §5.11's backend-mediated login remains the future
standalone-mode contract). The flow: `/login` redirects to
`{issuer}/protocol/openid-connect/auth`, `/auth/callback` validates `state`
and exchanges the code, the access token is stored in localStorage and sent
as `Authorization: Bearer` on every API call, and a stored refresh token
drives silent refresh on expiry. Sign out follows the session source: SSO
sessions redirect through the issuer's logout endpoint so the IdP session
dies too; local sessions revoke the PAT server-side first. A 401 on an
authenticated request clears the session and pages render a "sign in
required" state with an SSO button.

Two demo stacks exercise this (see the backend's `deploy/README.md`):

- `./deploy/up.sh auth` — Keycloak at `http://localhost:8090` (realm
  `mobula`, public client `mobula`, users `admin`/`operator`/`developer`/
  `viewer`, password = username). The login page offers SSO.
- The local-auth demo variant (`mobula serve --local-auth` with
  `MOBULA_LOCAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin`) — the login page renders the
  username/password form (`admin`/`admin`).

The SSO issuer falls back to `VITE_MOBULA_ISSUER` (default
`http://localhost:8090/realms/mobula`) only on backends that predate
`/api/v1/auth/providers`; when the backend reports an issuer it wins.
Paste-a-JWT sign-in remains as a collapsed "advanced" option on `/login`
for `mobula token`-minted service tokens (see the curl password-grant
one-liner rendered there).

With no token, a feature flag still controls the dev-auth stub that assumes
a fake **Admin** identity, so the unauthenticated demo stack
(`mobula serve --dev-allow-unauthenticated`) keeps working:

- `VITE_MOBULA_DEV_AUTH=true|false` — defaults to **on** under `vite dev`,
  **off** in production builds.
- With the flag off and no token, the shell offers a "Sign in" chip.

## Conventions worth knowing

- **State-machine fidelity**: the UI never invents cluster states. All badge
  rendering goes through `src/lib/cluster-state.ts`, which maps 1:1 to the
  backend's 9-state `ClusterState`.
- **Fail-closed errors**: API errors surface as `MobulaApiError` with
  `requiredRole`/`grantedRole` so 403s can render the denial (spec §1.4.6);
  404s from not-yet-implemented endpoints render a dedicated empty state.
- **Secrets are write-only**: the registry table shows "token set / not set",
  never a value or a reveal button.
- **No iframes anywhere** (D3/D6); the Swagger UI is linked, not embedded.
